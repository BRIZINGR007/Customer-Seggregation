# Customer-Seggregation
K-Means Algorithm is a clustering algorithm used for un-supervised Laerning. 
In this project I used K-Means Algorithm to seggregate customers based on different features and clustered similar customers .

After applying the algorithm and clustering th customers the insight that I got to better propel the business:
1.One insight that I got form the above clustering is that the business can give insentives or introduce membership to the (low-spending ,low_annual income) 
to increase the sales
2. Improve the user experince to increase the user experience for high annual income and low spenders.
